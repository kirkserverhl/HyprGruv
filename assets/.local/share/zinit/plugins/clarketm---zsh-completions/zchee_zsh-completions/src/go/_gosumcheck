#
# Gosumcheck checks a go.sum file against a go.sum database server.
#
# Usage:
#
#	gosumcheck [-h H] [-k key] [-u url] [-v] go.sum
#
# The -h flag changes the tile height (default 8).
#
# The -k flag changes the go.sum database server key.
#
# The -u flag overrides the URL of the server (usually set from the key name).
#
# The -v flag enables verbose output.
# In particular, it causes gosumcheck to report
# the URL and elapsed time for each server request.
#
# WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
#
# Gosumcheck is meant as a proof of concept demo and should not be
# used in production scripts or continuous integration testing.
# It does not cache any downloaded information from run to run,
# making it expensive and also keeping it from detecting server
# misbehavior or successful HTTPS man-in-the-middle timeline forks.
#
# To discourage misuse in automated settings, gosumcheck does not
# set any exit status to report whether any problems were found.
