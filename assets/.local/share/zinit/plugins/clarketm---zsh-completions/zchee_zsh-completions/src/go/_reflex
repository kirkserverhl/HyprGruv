#
# Usage: reflex [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
#
# COMMAND is any command you'd like to run. Any instance of {} will be replaced
# with the filename of the changed file. (The symbol may be changed with the
# --substitute flag.)
#
# OPTIONS are given below:
#       --all=false: 
#             Include normally ignored files (VCS and editor special files).
#   -c, --config="": 
#             A configuration file that describes how to run reflex
#             (or '-' to read the configuration from stdin).
#   -d, --decoration="plain": 
#             How to decorate command output. Choices: none, plain, fancy.
#   -g, --glob=[]: 
#             A shell glob expression to match filenames. (May be repeated.)
#   -G, --inverse-glob=[]: 
#             A shell glob expression to exclude matching filenames.
#             (May be repeated.)
#   -R, --inverse-regex=[]: 
#             A regular expression to exclude matching filenames.
#             (May be repeated.)
#       --only-dirs=false: 
#             Only match directories (not files).
#       --only-files=false: 
#             Only match files (not directories).
#   -r, --regex=[]: 
#             A regular expression to match filenames. (May be repeated.)
#   -e, --sequential=false: 
#             Don't run multiple commands at the same time.
#   -t, --shutdown-timeout=500ms: 
#             Allow services this long to shut down.
#   -s, --start-service=false: 
#             Indicates that the command is a long-running process to be
#             restarted on matching changes.
#       --substitute="{}": 
#             The substitution symbol that is replaced with the filename
#             in a command.
#   -v, --verbose=false: 
#             Verbose mode: print out more information about what reflex is doing.
#
# Examples:
#
#     # Print each .txt file if it changes
#     $ reflex -r '\.txt$' echo {}
#
#     # Run 'make' if any of the .c files in this directory change:
#     $ reflex -g '*.c' make
#
#     # Build and run a server; rebuild and restart when .java files change:
#     $ reflex -r '\.java$' -s -- sh -c 'make && java bin/Server'
#
# pflag: help requested
