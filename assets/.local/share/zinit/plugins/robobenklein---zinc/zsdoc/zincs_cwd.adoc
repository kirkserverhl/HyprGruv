zincs_cwd(1)
============
:compat-mode!:

NAME
----
zincs_cwd - a shell script

SYNOPSIS
--------

Current Working Directory

Renders segment content on the `chpwd` hook.
Has different strategy options for rendering the path.

Right now, the only strategies available are `rtab` and the shell default.

## Options:
- `$1`: FG
- `$2`: BG
- `$3`: Visual Draw Mode
- `$4`: Render Process Mode
- `$5`: DIR Display Strategy
- `$@`: Additional args passed to the chosen strategy


### Common optstrings:

Example dir: `/home/robo/code/configs/zsh`

|===
| optstring        | Example Output
| `;;;;rtab;`      | `/h/r/c/c/z`
| `;;;;rtab;-t;-l` | `~/c/con/zsh`
|===

### DIR Display Strategy

|===
| Strategy | Description | Example
| default | No shortening, just `%~` as evaluated by shell prompt expansion. | `~/code/zinc`
| `rtab` | Reverse tabbing function, has additional options | `~/c/zinc`, `~/c/p`, `/h/r/c/p`, etc
|===

### Strategy options:

#### `rtab`:

WARN: The `rtab` strategy uses a single subshell to explore the path.
Although it does spawn a subshell, it is seemingly more performant to explore
the path in a subshell rather than clean up and reset the main thread's chpwd
hooks, variables, etc.

Options can be set with `zstyle` calls, or as arguments `$6...N`

```
-f, --fish      fish-simulation, like -l -s -t
-l, --last      Print the last directory''s full name
-s, --short     Truncate directory names to the first character
-t, --tilde     Substitute ~ for the home directory
-T, --nameddirs Substitute named directories as well
The long options can also be set via zstyle, like
zstyle :prompt:rtab fish yes
```

Note:
____
Combined short form (`-sl`) options are *NOT* supported.
