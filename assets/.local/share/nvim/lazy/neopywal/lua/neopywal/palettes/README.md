# Alternative Palettes

This folder contains all the alternative palette files used by the `use_palette` option. It also includes a `templates` directory, which houses all the colorscheme `.json` templates used to generate these palette files with Pywal.

To generate any of the pre-made palette files found in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Copy the contents of the `templates` directory into your Pywal configuration folder under the `colorschemes` directory. For most users, this will be located at `~/.config/wal/colorschemes/`. For [Wallust](https://codeberg.org/explosion-mental/wallust) users, the directory will be `~/.config/wallust/colorschemes/`.

2. Run the following command in your shell:

```sh
$ wal --theme ~/.config/wal/colorschemes/path/to/theme.json

# Or for Wallust users.

$ wallust cs ~/.config/wallust/colorschemes/path/to/theme.json
```

This will generate a new `colors.vim` file under `~/.cache/wal/` containing the desired theme palette. Wallust users should also refer to the Neopywal.nvim [Wallust Setup Guide](https://github.com/RedsXDD/neopywal.nvim#Setting-up-Wallust).
